# Chapter 12

## Presentation of the repository
This repository contains the code that has been used for a subset of Chapter 12 figures.

The folder **Figures** contains the **data** and **scripts** in the eponym subfolders, and the associated figures in the **fig** subfolder for:
- figures 12.4 to 12.10
- and S12.1 to S12.6

The files in the folder **HIcalculation** contain the scripts that were used to calculate NOAA heat index (HI), perform bias correction, and obtain the yearly number of days on which HI exceeds a value of 41 deg Celsius. HI exceedances are shown shown in IPCC Figure 12.4 and Figure SM 12.2.

The folder **snow** contains the code to compute SWE100 snow index.
